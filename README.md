üìã Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js 16+
PostgreSQL database
Gemini API key
Installation Steps
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cp-assist.git
cd cp-assist
Install dependencies

npm install
Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/cpdb
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
Initialize the database

npm run db:push
Start the development server

npm run dev
Build for production

npm run build
npm start
üåü Usage Examples
Debug Mode
Input buggy code like:

int findMissingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
    }
    int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    return expectedSum - sum;
}
Receive detailed analysis:

‚ùå Bug Detected: Array index out of bounds at i = n
‚ö†Ô∏è Logic Error: The expected sum calculation is correct, but the actual sum computation has issues
üß† Solution: Fix the loop bounds and adjust the logic
‚è±Ô∏è Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
üìù Fixed Code: Properly implemented solution with explanation

Personalized problem recommendations based on your history
